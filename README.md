# Android Apps Download Prediction

## Abstract
In today's digital era, the Google Play Store hosts millions of applications catering to diverse user needs. For app developers and marketers, predicting the download count of an application prior to its launch is crucial for strategizing marketing campaigns, estimating revenue potential, and optimizing resource allocation. This project develops a predictive model for estimating the download count of Android applications based on various features available in the dataset.
